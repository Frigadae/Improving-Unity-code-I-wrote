# Improving Unity platformer code I wrote.
I recently experimented with unity and the first thing I did was implement various movement scripts. 
This repository is intended to document my progress tinkering with the Unity Engine and archiving my files and explaining how I improved my code.
Please read the document titled "Basic Directional Code for Unity" first, as it is the first page.

Be aware that some the code I used are copied from Youtube tutorials (with and without modification of my own). 
Others I formed my own ideas from reading the Unity Scripting documentation.

This repo is on hiatus at the moment while I try to sort out some other projects I need to do.
