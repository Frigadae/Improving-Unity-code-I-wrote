# Improving Unity platformer code I wrote.
I recently experimented with unity and the first thing I did was implement various movement scripts. 
This repository is intended to document my progress tinkering with the Unity Engine and archiving my files and explaining how I improved my code.
Be aware that some the code I used are copied from Youtube tutorials (with and without modification of my own). 
Others I formed my own ideas from reading the Unity Scripting documentation.
